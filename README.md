Automation
----------

Note that updating of documentation for APIs, manuals and builds is manual: only the conversion
of markdown to webpages is automatic. During this early stage we aren't versioned properly so there's
no clear way of determining what to do about regressions. The downside is that sometimes these are
slightly older copies than they could be, but the upside is that we have specifically chosen to
upload an edit that works.
